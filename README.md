## üìóOverview

Semi-hyperconverged [k3s](https://k3s.io/) GitOps managed cluster.

## Cluster Components

- [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) - GitOps operator for managing Kubernetes clusters from a Git repository
- [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) - Load balancer for Kubernetes services
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - Operator to request SSL certificates and store them as Kubernetes resources
- [calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) - Container networking interface for inter pod and service networking
- [multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni) - Enables multiple interfaces for pods to access my storage network and [whereabouts](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/whereabouts) to ensure consistent IP addressing across physical nodes
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) - Operator to publish DNS records to Cloudflare (and other providers) based on Kubernetes ingresses
- [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) - DNS resolver that provides local DNS to your Kubernetes ingresses
