## üìóOverview

Semi-hyperconverged [k3s](https://k3s.io/) GitOps managed cluster.

## Cluster Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) runs GitHub Actions as self-hosted runners on this cluster.
- [authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) provides single-sign-on and multifactor authentication.
- [calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) CNI providing networking between pods, services and exposes services via BGP and multipath.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) requests SSL certificates, both self-signed and from [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and stores them as Kubernetes resources.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) publishes DNS records to [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) only from explicitly annotated ingress objects.  An additional instance publishes all ingresses and services to internal [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) servers which automates split domain routing.
- [external-secrets](https://external-secrets.io/) provides secret management between this cluster's resources and those stored in [azure keyvault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault/).
- [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) GitOps operator that keeps this cluster in sync with this Git repository.
- [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) ingress controller that publishes web apps through a HTTP reverse proxy from Kubernetes ingresses.
- [multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni) enables pods access to seperate VLANs and/or physical networks with [whereabouts](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/whereabouts) to ensure consistent IP addressing across physical nodes (Rook Ceph requirement if storage and host traffic are to be separated).
- [rook-ceph](https://github.com/rook/rook) manages a ceph cluster that provides replicated persistent storage.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) and [snapscheduler](https://github.com/backube/snapscheduler) enable restic backup and recovery of persistent volume claims to [azure blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs).

Additional applications include [hajimari](https://github.com/toboshii/hajimari), [error-pages](https://github.com/tarampampam/error-pages), [echo-server](https://github.com/Ealenn/Echo-Server), [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller), [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader), [kured](https://github.com/weaveworks/kured) and more.
