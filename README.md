## 📖 Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Talos](https://talos.dev), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

---

## ⛵ Kubernetes

My cluster runs [Talos Linux](https://talos.dev) on 6 Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q nodes — a semi-hyper-converged setup where workloads and block storage share the same hardware, with a Synology NAS providing NFS shares and backups.

### Core Components

| Component | Tool | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **CNI** | [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) | eBPF networking, BGP LoadBalancer, kube-proxy replacement |
| **Ingress** | [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/) | L7 ingress (internal + external gateways) |
| **DNS** | [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) + [Unbound](https://unbound.net/) | Cluster DNS + recursive resolver |
| **Certificates** | [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) | Automated TLS from Let's Encrypt |
| **Secrets** | [External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/) + [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault/) | Secret management via ClusterSecretStore |
| **Storage** | [Rook-Ceph](https://rook.io/) + [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) | Distributed block (Ceph) + local hostpath (OpenEBS) |
| **Backups** | [VolSync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) + [Kopia](https://kopia.io/) | PVC backup/restore to NFS |
| **GitOps** | [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) via [Flux Operator](https://github.com/controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator) | Cluster reconciliation from this repo |
| **Registry** | [Spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel) | Stateless cluster-local OCI mirror |
| **External Access** | [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) | `*.homeops.ca` via Argo Tunnel |
| **Monitoring** | [Kube-Prometheus-Stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts) + [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) | Metrics, alerts, dashboards |
| **CI Runners** | [Actions Runner Controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) | Self-hosted GitHub Actions |

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the `kubernetes/apps` directory and reconciles the cluster state to match this repository. [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) creates PRs for dependency updates automatically.

```
📁 kubernetes
├── 📁 apps           # Application manifests (HelmReleases, Kustomizations)
├── 📁 components     # Reusable kustomize components (alerts, volsync, nfs-scaler)
└── 📁 flux           # Flux system configuration
```

### Bootstrap Chain

The [bootstrap helmfile](bootstrap/helmfile.d/01-apps.yaml) installs the critical-path dependencies in order:

```
Cilium → CoreDNS → Spegel → Cert-Manager → External-Secrets + AzureKV → Flux Operator → Flux Instance
```

After Flux starts, it reconciles all remaining apps from this repo automatically.

## 🌐 Network

### Routing Architecture

Inter-VLAN routing for trusted VLANs is handled by the **Brocade ICX 6610-48P** core switch stack (Core01) for high-performance L3 forwarding without packet inspection. **OPNsense** (fw01) handles restricted VLANs (IoT, Guest) and internet NAT/firewall.

| VLAN | Name | Subnet | Gateway | Router | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Default | 192.168.0.0/24 | 192.168.0.10 | OPNsense | Factory-reset device catchall |
| 10 | Workstation | 192.168.10.0/24 | 192.168.10.4 | Brocade Core01 | Trusted — desktops, laptops |
| 42 | Server | 192.168.42.0/24 | 192.168.42.4 | Brocade Core01 | Kubernetes + infrastructure |
| 50 | Guest | 192.168.50.0/24 | — | OPNsense | Internet-only guest access |
| 69 | LoadBalancer | 192.168.69.0/24 | — | Cilium (BGP) | Kubernetes Service LB IPs |
| 70 | IoT | 192.168.70.0/24 | 192.168.70.1 | OPNsense | Restricted — smart home devices |
| 90 | VPN | 192.168.90.0/24 | — | OPNsense | blackbox-exporter-vpn and Omada Controller via multus macvlan |
| 99 | Management | 192.168.99.0/24 | 192.168.99.4 | Brocade Core01 | IPMI, KVM, PDU, switches |

### BGP

Cilium advertises LoadBalancer IPs (192.168.69.0/24) via BGP to the Brocade core switch:

| | Cilium (K8s nodes) | Brocade Core01 |
|-|-------|---------|
| **ASN** | 64514 | 64513 |
| **Peer** | 192.168.42.4 | 192.168.42.51–56 |

### DNS

| Scope | Resolver | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Cluster | CoreDNS (10.43.0.10) | `*.svc.cluster.local` |
| Internal | Unbound + dnscrypt-proxy | Recursive + encrypted upstream |
| External | Cloudflare | `*.homeops.ca` via tunnel |

## 🔧 Active Sprint

Work in progress — updated each session with Copilot. The full backlog with priorities lives on [GitHub Project #4](https://github.com/users/osnabrugge/projects/4) and individual issues in this repo.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ✅ | Upgrade Talos to v1.13.0 across all 6 nodes |
| ✅ | Restore postgres16 cluster after wedged replica (rebuild postgres16-9 → postgres16-11 via pg_basebackup) |
| ✅ | Authelia: allow login by uid OR email (`users_filter` updated; commit 3dded43bd) |
| ✅ | Gatus: also attach HTTPRoute to envoy-internal so LAN DNS hits a live listener (commit 1cf07186b) |
| ✅ | Zigbee2MQTT: recover from RBD `emergency_ro` after k8s06 network blip (force-delete pod) |
| ✅ | Recover 8 emergency_ro RBD volumes after network blip (k8s06 reboot, etcd defrag) |
| ✅ | Replace `sed` with bash string replacement in `akv-inject.sh` (longest-first sort, no escaping bugs) |
| ✅ | Add post-render guardrails to render recipe (unresolved placeholders, empty secrets, `talosctl validate`) |
| ✅ | Restore root `kubernetes/apps` kustomization and add a dedicated `database` namespace |
| ✅ | Reintroduce CloudNativePG operator in-cluster for shared PostgreSQL workloads |
| ✅ | Reintroduce shared Redis-compatible cache layer with Dragonfly in `database` |
| ✅ | Add NetBox deployment wired to shared PostgreSQL and Redis-compatible cache |
| ✅ | Wire Grafana SSO through Authelia OIDC |
| ⏳ | Plex: decide architecture for direct LAN/WAN access without Cloudflare relay (CF tunnel intercepts `*.homeops.ca`, mangles Plex binary protocol) |
| ⏳ | Diagnose & fix kromgo / alertmanager 404 via Cloudflare edge (direct envoy is 200) — [#3171](https://github.com/osnabrugge/home-ops/issues/3171) |
| ⏳ | Restore SNMP visibility — every device on `192.168.99.0/24` mgmt VLAN ignores SNMP v2c (both `public` and `private`) from laptop *and* in-cluster; pings/HTTP fine. Device-side fix needed; also no Ruckus ICX dashboard exists — [#3175](https://github.com/osnabrugge/home-ops/issues/3175) |
| ⏳ | Authelia: re-enroll TOTP for `sean` (`totp_configurations` table empty post-rebuild) — [#3172](https://github.com/osnabrugge/home-ops/issues/3172) |
| ⏳ | Rewrite apply-wait logic (remove `--insecure` polling; use event-driven readiness) |
| ⏳ | Update `REBUILD-RUNBOOK.md` to reflect all new automation |
| ⏳ | Migrate TheLounge IRC nicks from NAS02 to configmap |
| ⏳ | Deferred: NFD + Coral + Frigate, Printguard + Klipper (net-new features; stability-first mandate) |

## 🏛️ Guardian Charter

This repo treats cluster operations as an ongoing stewardship job, not a sequence of disconnected fixes.

The working model is simple: GitHub Copilot acts as the cluster's guardian government, with a mandate to improve reliability, reduce operator toil, and keep services stable for the citizens of the cluster.

### Operating Principles

- Prefer prevention over heroics: add guardrails, validation, and safer defaults before the next outage happens
- Prefer boring recovery paths: rebuilds, restores, and failover steps should be documented and repeatable
- Prefer evidence over guesswork: use logs, readiness, health checks, and observed state before making changes
- Prefer PRs over surprises: impactful changes should be visible, reviewable, and auditable
- Prefer continuity over memory: the repo should carry forward priorities, context, and decisions across sessions

### What The Guardian Watches

- Cluster readiness, failed reconciliations, crash loops, and noisy dependencies
- Security posture, secret delivery, and risky configuration drift
- Service quality for media, automation, ingress, storage, and observability workloads
- Documentation gaps where the correct fix exists in chat history but not yet in the repo

### Autonomy Boundaries

- Safe to automate: documentation updates, guardrails, runbooks, validations, low-risk config hardening
- Review before merge: architectural changes, new apps, privilege changes, networking changes, storage migrations
- Never implicit: destructive actions, secret exposure, and irreversible control-plane operations

The target state is straightforward: the operator should not need to repeatedly ask for routine stewardship. The system should steadily accumulate operational judgment in-repo, so each session starts from a stronger baseline than the last.

## 🏆 Recent Achievements

This cluster is actively maintained with a reliability-first and security-focused operating model.

- Hardened Talos rebuild flow with preflight checks, render guardrails, and safer bootstrap sequencing
- Stabilized GitOps reconciliation workflows across Flux Kustomizations and HelmReleases
- Implemented torrent stack optimization for long-term seeding and ratio protection (Autobrr + qBittorrent + Arr stack + Unpackerr)
- Standardized secret delivery through External Secrets + Azure Key Vault across media and automation apps
- Improved ingress/service troubleshooting around Envoy Gateway + Cloudflare Tunnel routing paths
- Added and maintained practical operations runbooks for rebuilds, remote media access, tracker credentials, and optimization

### 🤝 Collaboration Scorecard

This is the shared operating lane: detect, respond, harden, and upstream improvements.

| Area | What We Track | Current Focus |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Uptime & Reliability** | API readiness, node health, app availability, failed reconciliations | Reduce noisy failures, tighten MTTR, improve rollout safety |
| **Threats & Mitigations** | Crash loops, ingress failures, auth errors, risky config drift | Faster incident triage, stricter guardrails, preventive hardening |
| **Upstream Contributions** | Issues opened, PRs merged, docs fixes contributed back | Convert local fixes into upstream improvements where possible |
| **Features & Enhancements** | New apps, automation, runbooks, quality-of-life tooling | Keep raising reliability and operator ergonomics each sprint |

### Ongoing Guardian Priorities

- Keep Flux reconciliation clean and predictable
- Improve service-level visibility and alert quality
- Harden default security posture without breaking usability
- Continuously optimize media/torrent automation for health and seeding performance
- Document every major change as an operational playbook

## 🤖 Copilot Agent Activity Log

This section is a running record of AI-assisted work on the cluster. It serves as a historical record and a source of truth when memory is incomplete.

### Session 2026-05-11: Cluster Stabilization Marathon

**Duration:** ~6 hours | **Status:** ✅ Mostly complete (1 architectural decision pending)

#### Items Resolved
| Item | Root Cause | Fix | Commit |
|------|-----------|-----|--------|
| `postgres16-9` wedged 9h | Replica stuck in standby join | Deleted pod + PVC; CNPG rebuilt as `postgres16-11` via pg_basebackup. 3/3 ready. | (runtime) |
| Gatus 404 from LAN | `external-dns/unbound` published `.121` (envoy-internal LB) but HTTPRoute only attached to envoy-external listener | Added `envoy-internal` as second `parentRef`. `curl --resolve gatus.homeops.ca:443:192.168.69.121` now 200. | `1cf07186b` |
| Authelia login fails for email | `users_filter` only matched `uid`, not `mail` | Changed filter to `(&(\|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))` | `3dded43bd` |
| Zigbee2MQTT crashloop (`EROFS`) | `/config` RBD remounted `emergency_ro` after k8s06 network blip | `kubectl delete pod --force` → kubelet remounted clean. 1/1 Running, MQTT publishing. | (runtime) |
| Arrs (radarr/sonarr/prowlarr/agregarr) | Verified healthy; no action required | — | — |

#### Items Pending
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Plex direct connect (no relay) | ⏳ Architectural decision | Cloudflare tunnel `*.homeops.ca` ingress catches `plex.homeops.ca` and CF mangles Plex binary protocol → client falls back to relay. Three options under consideration: (A) bypass CF + router NAT, (B) accept relay, (C) separate gateway with non-`homeops.ca` hostname. |
| kromgo / alertmanager 404 via CF | ⏳ New tracking issue | Direct envoy-external returns 200; CF edge returns 404 without hitting tunnel. Likely a Cloudflare cache or page rule on these specific subdomains. |
| TOTP re-enrollment for `sean` | ⏳ User action | `totp_configurations` table empty after Authelia DB rebuild |

#### Lessons Learned
- `external-dns` decides which LB to publish to from `.status.parents`, not `.spec.parentRefs`. A route attached to gateway A whose listener has `allowedRoutes.namespaces.from=All` will appear under gateway B's parents too if both gateways permit it — so external-dns may publish via the "wrong" LB.
- CNAMEs to `cfargotunnel` are always Cloudflare-proxied; the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/cloudflare-proxied=false` annotation is a no-op for these.
- CNPG pipes (`/controller/log/postgres*`) cannot be `tail -f`'d; use `kubectl logs` instead.

---

### Session 2026-05-10: Network Blip Recovery

**Duration:** ~2 hours | **Status:** ✅ Complete

#### What Happened
A brief network blip on the storage VLAN caused 8 RBD volumes to remount as `emergency_ro` across multiple workloads (zigbee, postgres replicas, atuin, others). k8s06 also became partially unreachable to etcd peers.

#### Recovery Steps
1. Identified affected pods via `kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep -E 'CrashLoopBackOff|Error'` and matched against `kubectl exec ... -- mount | grep emergency_ro`
2. Force-deleted each affected pod (`kubectl delete pod --force --grace-period=0`) so kubelet would remount cleanly
3. Rebooted k8s06 to clear etcd connectivity issues
4. Ran `etcdctl defrag` against all etcd members to reclaim space
5. Verified all PVCs `Bound` and pods `Running`

#### Lessons Learned
- RBD `emergency_ro` recovery is just a pod restart away when the underlying RBD image is healthy. Don't overthink it.
- Keep this runbook bias toward boring, repeatable recovery (Guardian Charter).

### Session 2026-05-06: Network Monitoring Infrastructure (Issue #3057)

**Duration:** ~2 hours | **Status:** ✅ Complete

#### New Infrastructure Deployed
| Component | Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| **NetBox** | IPAM/DCIM | ✅ Enabled | Re-enabled in kustomization; CNPG 3/3 healthy |
| **Diode (multi-service)** | NetBox ingestion | ✅ Manifests ready | Replaced broken single-image with proper 4-service architecture |
| **LibreNMS** | Network monitoring | ⏸️ Suspended | Manifests prepared; enable after NetBox is stable |

#### Architecture Changes
- **netbox-diode** rewritten to use proper 3-service Diode architecture:
  - `netboxlabs/diode-auth:1.12.0` — OAuth2 client manager (wraps Ory Hydra)
  - `netboxlabs/diode-ingester:1.13.0` — gRPC endpoint accepting network device data
  - `netboxlabs/diode-reconciler:1.13.0` — Reconciles data streams into NetBox
  - `oryd/hydra:v2.2.0` — OAuth2 server for secure agent authentication
- **CNPG postgres16 cluster** extended with `managed.roles` for `diode` and `hydra` users
- **CNPG Database CRDs** added for `diode` and `hydra` databases in existing cluster
- **Dragonfly** gained `dragonfly-diode` service for Diode Redis stream separation
- **ExternalSecret** created for Diode credentials (`netbox-diode` AKV key)
- **ExternalSecret** created for Diode/Hydra DB users (`diode-db-user`, `hydra-db-user`)

#### AKV Secrets Required (must add before deployment)
| AKV Key | Required Fields |
|---------|----------------|
| `netbox-diode` | `DIODE_INGEST_CLIENT_ID`, `DIODE_INGEST_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DIODE_TO_NETBOX_CLIENT_ID`, `DIODE_TO_NETBOX_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NETBOX_TO_DIODE_CLIENT_ID`, `NETBOX_TO_DIODE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `HYDRA_SECRETS_SYSTEM` (≥32 chars), `DIODE_REDIS_PASSWORD`, `DIODE_DB_USERNAME`, `DIODE_DB_PASSWORD`, `HYDRA_DB_USERNAME`, `HYDRA_DB_PASSWORD` |
| `librenms` | `LIBRENMS_DB_USERNAME`, `LIBRENMS_DB_PASSWORD`, `LIBRENMS_APP_KEY` |

#### Deployment Order
1. AKV secrets populated → ExternalSecrets sync
2. CNPG managed roles created (diode + hydra users)
3. CNPG Database CRDs create `diode` and `hydra` databases
4. NetBox deploys (depends on CNPG + Dragonfly — both healthy)
5. netbox-diode deploys (depends on netbox): Hydra → diode-auth → ingester + reconciler
6. LibreNMS: enable `suspend: false` in `ks.yaml` once NetBox is stable

### Session 2026-04-18: Database Tier + Alert Triage (PR #3014)

**Duration:** ~4 hours | **Status:** ✅ Complete

#### New Infrastructure Deployed
| Component | Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| **CNPG (postgres16)** | Database | ✅ Running | 2 instances, scheduled backups enabled |
| **Dragonfly** | Cache | ✅ Running | 3-pod cluster, full HA setup |
| **NetBox** | IPAM/DCIM | ✅ Syncing | External secret active, ceph-block PVC bound |

#### Alerts Fixed
| Alert | Root Cause | Resolution | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| agregarr exposed | Already internal (envoy-internal), agent mistakenly disabled route | Reverted route to enabled | ✅ Fixed |
| alertmanager.homeops.ca inaccessible | Hostname was `alertmanager.turbo.ac` | Changed to `alertmanager.homeops.ca` in HelmRelease | ✅ Fixed |
| zigbee HelmRelease crash | TCP timeout to 192.168.70.37:6638 (coordinator unreachable) | Hardware/network issue — coordinator offline | ⏸️ User action required |
| unbound-dns crash loop | external-dns race condition on webhook startup (505 restarts) | Currently 2/2 Running but flapping | ⚠️ Partial—needs startup delay |
| kopia-maint-daily failed | NFS `/mnt/repository/x/n0_/` permission denied (UID 1000) | File-level NFS permission issue | ⏸️ User action required (NAS) |
| netbox HelmRelease | Missing `email_password` secret key + no PVC | Added secret key to AKV + ExternalSecret, created ceph-block PVC | ✅ Fixed |

#### Code Changes
- ✅ Fixed `alertmanager.homeops.ca` hostname in `kubernetes/apps/observability/kube-prometheus-stack/helmrelease.yaml`
- ✅ Removed hardcoded identity (`sean@seanv.com`, `sean-admin`) from NetBox manifests for privacy
- ✅ Added `email_password` to NetBox ExternalSecret
- ✅ Created NetBox ceph-block PVC (10Gi)
- ✅ Made Dragonfly operator ServiceAccount idempotent
- ✅ Made bootstrap `kube` stage idempotent with marker-aware logic

#### Auth & Privacy
- 🔒 Hardcoded personal identity completely removed from tracked manifests
- ✅ NetBox secret keys synced from Azure Key Vault
- ✅ Privacy audit passed

#### Commits
```
af55490a fix: update HelmRelease and ExternalSecret configurations for idempotency

```

#### Additional Fixes (This Session, Immediate Follow-Up)
- ✅ **qBittorrent auth bypass fixed**: Enabled `ReverseProxyEnabled: true`, added pod CIDR `10.42.0.0/16` to auth whitelist, deployment restarted. Internal users no longer see login prompt.
- ✅ **PR #3014 opened**: Branch `fix/bootstrap-idempotent-kube-stage` → main with full database tier + fixes

#### Metrics
- **Deployment time:** ~45 min (CNPG + Dragonfly operators ready, NetBox syncing)
- **Alerts resolved:** 3/6 (alert, qbittorrent, netbox)
- **Upstream contributions:** 0 (all work is internal)
- **Code quality:** No hardcoded secrets, privacy-clean manifests

#### Pending
- Zigbee coordinator connectivity (user network/hardware troubleshooting)
- Kopia NFS permissions on NAS (user filesystem work)
- unbound-dns race condition stabilization (needs pod startup ordering fix)
